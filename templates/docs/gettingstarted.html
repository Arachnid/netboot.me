    <h2>Using netboot.me</h2>
    <p>There are several ways to boot into netboot.me, depending on your needs.</p>
    
    <h3>Booting from CD</h3>
    <p>Download and save <a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/Arachnid/netboot.me-gpxe/netbootme.iso">netbootme.iso</a>,
    then burn it to CD using your usual CD burning program. In linux, you can use
    cdrecord, OSX users can use the built-in Disk Utility, and windows users can
    use tools such as Nero Burning Rom.</p>
    <p>Once you have burned netbootme.iso to a CD, make sure your target computer
    is set up to boot from CD, insert the CD in the drive, and reboot it.</p>
    
    <h3>Booting from USB</h3>
    <p>You can also boot from USB. To do so, download and save
    <a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/Arachnid/netboot.me-gpxe/netbootme.usb">netbootme.usb</a>,
    then follow the OS specific instructions below.</p>
    
    <h4>Writing a USB image in Linux</h4>
    <p>Insert the USB key, and establish which device Linux has assigned to the
    USB key. Then, enter the following command:
    <code>dd if=netbootme.usb of=/dev/sdX</code>
    where <em>/dev/sdX</em> is the device assigned to your USB key. Make sure
    you enter the right device name - this will erase anything on the device
    you choose!</p>
    
    <h4>Writing a USB image in Mac OSX</h4>
    <p>Insert the USB key, and run <em>mount</em> to see what device OSX has
    assigned to your USB key. You should see something like this:
    <code>/dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled)<br />
devfs on /dev (devfs, local)<br />
fdesc on /dev (fdesc, union)<br />
/dev/disk3s1 on /Volumes/UNTITLED (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)</code>
    The last line is your USB device. Unmount it and write the netboot.me image
    to it with:
    <code>sudo umount -f /dev/disk3s1<br />
dd if=netbootme.usb of=/dev/disk3</code>
    If successful, OSX will pop up an error dialog telling you it doesn't
    recognize the disk. Click 'Eject', remove the USB key, and you're done.</p>
    
    <h4>Writing a USB image in Windows</h4>
    <p>Coming soon...</p>
    
    <h3>Booting from floppy disk</h3>
    <p>If you have a computer that still has a floppy drive, it's possible to
    boot from that, too. Download and save <a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/Arachnid/netboot.me-gpxe/netbootme.dsk">netbootme.dsk</a>,
    then follow the same steps as described above for writing the USB disk image.</p>
    
    <h3>Booting using tftp.netboot.me</h3>
    <p>Most computers are capable of netbooting when configured correclty, without
    the requirement of a boot disk of any sort. This can be used to bootstrap
    from 'regular' netbooting to the HTTP-based approach used by netboot.me.
    There are two major steps required to configure netbooting:</p>
    
    <h4>Setting up DHCP</h4>
    <p>In order for your computer to know where to find the netboot servers,
    you need to change your DHCP settings to return some extra information. The
    two relevant pieces of information: next-server, which should be
    "tftp.netboot.me", and "filename", which should be "netbootme.kpxe". How to
    set these settings depends on your DHCP server. For dhcpd, simply add the
    following to the relevant 'subnet' section of your configuration:
    <code>    next-server "tftp.netboot.me"<br />    filename "netbootme.kpxe"</code>
    For dnsmasq, the following line in /etc/dnsmasq.conf will achieve the same
    effect: <code>dhcp-boot=netbootme.kpxe,tftp.netboot.me</code></p>
    
    <h4>Setting your computer to netboot</h4>
    <p>How to configure your computer to netboot varies from computer to computer.
    Many computers will automatically try to netboot if they don't find any bootable
    devices. Check your BIOS settings to see if there's a way to explicitly enable
    network booting, and to set its priority relative to other boot devices.
    Some bioses also provide the option to netboot if you press a function key
    while booting - watch your boot screen carefully.</p>
    
    <h4>Debugging</h4>
    <p>The method described above relies on bootstrapping from your computer's
    built in PXE (netboot) support by sending a copy of a more sophisticated
    bootloader (gPXE) over TFTP, the Trivial File Transfer Protocol. Unfortunately,
    TFTP isn't the most reliable protocol across the internet, and it doesn't
    always work if the computer you're booting is behind NAT, either.</p>
    <p>If you've completed the steps above and your computer can't download the
    image, you may be running into such problems. Not to worry, though, there's
    a simple alternative: you can host the bootstrap image yourself. See the
    section below for instructions.</p>
    
    <h3>Booting using DHCP and your own TFTP server</h3>
    <p>The option described above for netbooting is simple, but doesn't work for
    everyone due to the issues inherent in using TFTP across the internet. You
    can host your own copy of the bootstrap image, however, which will allow you
    to use netboot.me without boot disks.</p>
    <p>If you're using dnsmasq, doing this is really easy. Download
    <a href="http://static.netboot.me/gpxe/netbootme.kpxe">netbootme.kxpe</a>
    and save it to the machine running dnsmasq, under /var/lib/tftp. Then, add
    the following lines to /etc/dnsmasq.conf:
    <code>enable-tftp<br />tftp-root=/etc/dnsmasq.conf<br />dhcp-boot=netbootme.kpxe</code></p>
    <p>If you're using DHCPd, you'll need to set up your own TFTP server -
    tftpd-hal is a good choice. Once you've set it up, add the location of your
    TFTP server to the DHCPd configuration file, as shown above.</p>
