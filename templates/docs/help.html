    <a name="whatis"><h3>What is netboot.me?</h3></a>
    <p>netboot.me is a service that allows you to boot nearly any operating system
    or tool on any computer with a wired internet connection - without having to
    know ahead of time what tools you need. Once you can netboot.me, you never
    need to update your tools again!</p>
    
    <p>netboot.me works through the magic of netbooting. There are a number of
    ways to boot a computer with netboot.me. The simplest is to
    <a href="/gettingstarted">download</a> a bootable image and burn it to a CD, USB
    memory stick, or floppy disk. Boot off it on any networked computer, and it
    will automatically fetch the latest boot options from netboot.me and let you
    choose from dozens of installation, recovery, testing, portable desktop and
    other tools. You can also start netboot.me from any computer running gPXE,
    or from any netbootable computer with some simple tweaks to your DHCP server.</p>
    
    <a name="why"><h3>Why would I use netboot.me?</h3></a>
    <p>netboot.me is useful in a number of situations. You can use it as an installer
    for any number of operating systems and distros, as a rescue disk for a wide
    variety of setups, as a testing and diagnostic utility for memory, disk, CPU
    and other components, or even as an instant desktop environment!</p>
    <p>The most important advantage of netboot.me is that you don't have to plan
    ahead in order to take advantage of it. Often, you don't know you're going
    to need a diagnostic tool until you do - at which point it may be too late
    to download it! You can download the netboot.me bootloader once, keep it
    with you when you might need it, and never have to worry about updates again.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of netboot.me is for performing OS installations.
    When you download a distribution of Linux or another OSS operating system, 
    much of the software on it is already obsolete, requiring you to upgrade it
    as soon as you finish installing. With netboot installations, however, the
    downloaded packages are always the latest, eliminating the need for an update
    and reducing the total amount you have to download.</p>

    <a name="#oss"><h3>Is netboot.me Open Source Software?</h3></a>
    <p>Yes! netboot.me is licensed under the BSD license. You can find the source
    for the site <a href="http://github.com/arachnid/netboot.me/">here</a>,
    and the source for the modified version of the gPXE bootloader used by netboot.me
    <a href="http://github.com/arachnid/netboot.me-gpxe">here</a>. Contributions
    are welcomed. If you'd like to create your own netboot.me clone, you're
    welcome to, but please credit the original!</p>
    
    <a name="#chainload"><h3>What are all these 'chainload URLs'?</h3></a>
    <p>When you know exactly what you want to boot, it can be convenient to
    bypass some or all of the menu system. The chainload URLs exist to facilitate
    that. To boot directly into a configuration, start up your computer as you
    would normally when booting netboot.me, and press Ctrl+B when prompted.
    Then, type "autoboot" to detect and initialize your network interfaces. When
    that returns, type "chain &lt;url>". Where &lt;url> is the chainload URL
    displayed on the relevant configuration page. For example, to boot directly
    into Memtest 86, you would type the following at the gPXE command prompt:
    <code>gPXE> autoboot<br />gPXE> chain http://netboot.me/1001</code>.</p>
    
    <a name="#bugs"><h3>How can I report bugs and feature requests?</h3></a>
    <p>You can submit bugs and feature requests
    <a href="http://github.com/Arachnid/netboot.me/issues">here</a>. Please
    search before you submit - voting for an existing issue counts for more than
    creating a new one!</p>
    
    <a name="#submit"><h3>How can I suggest a new configuration for the menu?</h3></a>
    <p>You can create a new config from your 'My Configs' page, or by clicking
    <a href="/my/newconfig">here</a>. Once you have created a config and tested
    it, <a href="http://github.com/Arachnid/netboot.me/issues">file a feature
    request</a> to have it added to the menu.</p>
