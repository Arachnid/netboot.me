    <a name="whatis"><h3>What is netboot.me?</h3></a>
    <p>netboot.me is a service that allows you to boot nearly any operating system
    or tool on any computer with a wired internet connection - without having to
    know ahead of time what tools you need. Once you can netboot.me, you never
    need to update your tools again!</p>
    
    <p>netboot.me works through the magic of netbooting. There are a number of
    ways to boot a computer with netboot.me. The simplest is to
    <a href="/gettingstarted">download</a> a bootable image and burn it to a CD, USB
    memory stick, or floppy disk. Boot off it on any networked computer, and it
    will automatically fetch the latest boot options from netboot.me and let you
    choose from dozens of installation, recovery, testing, portable desktop and
    other tools. You can also start netboot.me from any computer running gPXE,
    or from any netbootable computer with some simple tweaks to your DHCP server.</p>
    
    <a name="why"><h3>Why would I use netboot.me?</h3></a>
    <p>netboot.me is useful in a number of situations. You can use it as an installer
    for any number of operating systems and distros, as a rescue disk for a wide
    variety of setups, as a testing and diagnostic utility for memory, disk, CPU
    and other components, or even as an instant desktop environment!</p>
    <p>The most important advantage of netboot.me is that you don't have to plan
    ahead in order to take advantage of it. Often, you don't know you're going
    to need a diagnostic tool until you do - at which point it may be too late
    to download it! You can download the netboot.me bootloader once, keep it
    with you when you might need it, and never have to worry about updates again.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of netboot.me is for performing OS installations.
    When you download a distribution of Linux or another OSS operating system, 
    much of the software on it is already obsolete, requiring you to upgrade it
    as soon as you finish installing. With netboot installations, however, the
    downloaded packages are always the latest, eliminating the need for an update
    and reducing the total amount you have to download.</p>

    <a name="create"><h3>Can I create my own configurations?</h3></a>
    <p>Log in by clicking on the log in link in the header (a Google account
    is required), then <a href="/my/newconfig">create a config</a> from your
    "My Configs" page. Once you've created it, follow the directions below to
    boot it and try it out. If you think it will be of general interest,
    <a href="http://github.com/Arachnid/netboot.me/issues">file a bug</a> for it
    to be included in the menu.</p>
    
    <a name="chainload"><h3>How can I boot a configuration that's not on the menu?</h3></a>
    <p>When you know exactly what you want to boot, it can be convenient to
    bypass some or all of the menu system. To boot directly into a configuration,
    start up your computer as you would normally when booting netboot.me, and 
    press any key when the message "Press any key for options or wait n seconds"
    is displayed. Then, select the option titled "Boot a configuration directly",
    and enter the ID of your configuration (the last part of the URL) and press
    enter to boot it. For example, to boot directly into Memtest 86, you would 
    enter the number '3005'.</p>
    
    <a name="vesa"><h3>The default menu doesn't work for me</h3></a>
    <p>Some systems have trouble with the default (graphical) menu. If your system
    is one of those, simply press any key when prompted to "Press any key for options
    or wait n seconds", and select the text menu option from the resulting display.</p>
    
    <a name="bugs"><h3>How can I report bugs and feature requests?</h3></a>
    <p>You can submit bugs and feature requests
    <a href="http://github.com/Arachnid/netboot.me/issues">here</a>. Please
    search before you submit - voting for an existing issue counts for more than
    creating a new one!</p>
    
    <a name="group"><h3>Is there a discussion group or forum?</h3></a>
    <p>A general discussion group is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/netbootme-discuss">here</a>.</p>
    
    <a name="oss"><h3>Is netboot.me Open Source Software?</h3></a>
    <p>Yes! netboot.me is licensed under the BSD license. You can find the source
    for the site <a href="http://github.com/arachnid/netboot.me/">here</a>,
    and the source for the modified version of the gPXE bootloader used by netboot.me
    <a href="http://github.com/arachnid/netboot.me-gpxe">here</a>. Contributions
    are welcomed. If you'd like to create your own netboot.me clone, you're
    welcome to, but please credit the original!</p>
